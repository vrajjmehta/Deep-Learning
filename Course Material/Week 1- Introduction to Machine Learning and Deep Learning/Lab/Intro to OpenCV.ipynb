The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc. \n","It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available. A full-featured CUDAand OpenCL interfaces are being actively developed right now. \n","\n","Source: https://opencv.org/about.html\n","\n","## What is image & pixel?\n","\n","Computer considers an image as a matrix; each value in the matrix represents a single pixel. A pixel is a basic building block of an image. A pixel has a value between 0 and 255, whereas the value of 0 represents complete black and 255 represent complete white. The shade of the color varies between 0 and 255 to show various. Similarly, a pixel in RGB image is represented by tuple such as (red, green, blue)\n","\n","What is the color of the image having a value of (255,255,255)?   \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TpdsmMaOSGk2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# import the packages required \n","# CV2 is the package used for image processing and computer vision tasks\n","import cv2    \n","\n","# matplotlib is plotting library used for displaying images\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  \n","\n","# Numpy is for matrix computation\n","import numpy as np\n","from IPython.display import display, HTML, clear_output\n","\n","# Which version of OpenCV is used?\n","print(cv2.__version__)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tBxE_7siTOPl","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Connecting to Google Drive"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"m0EvivP9TUVs","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"59h3pb1A7j1R","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Change directory to the OpenCV folder under Week1-Lab1"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KAnxgrbrUP_W","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["cd /content/gdrive/My Drive/42028-DL-CNN-2020/Week1-Lab1/OpenCV/"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZKFqJ0NXqM8R","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Unzip the dataset file"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"weYlbTrywvM3","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["!unzip dataset.zip"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EeoabHylzCCu","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Change the Directory to the dataset folder"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8zPSXB6KzD1D","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["cd dataset/"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4SSSaCJCSGlA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Reading a Image using imread() function\n","load the image\n","img= cv2.imread(path to image)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"DGmyM3dlSGlE","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["img=cv2.imread('lena.png')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x3Nc0rVPSGlK","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["if img is None:\n","    print('Image not found')\n","else:\n","    print('Image Loaded')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TrjYyhBuSGlS","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Display information about image\n","\n","Images are read as a numpy array.
